"""
Python makes performing file I/O simple. Take a look
at how to read and write to files here: 

https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files

The first argument is a string containing the filename. 
The second argument is another string containing a few characters describing the way in which the file will be used. 
mode can be 'r' when the file will only be read, 'w' for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased), and 'a' opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the end. 'r+' opens the file for both reading and writing. 
The mode argument is optional; 'r' will be assumed if itâ€™s omitted.

# Open up the "foo.txt" file (which already exists) for reading
# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file

# Open up a file called "bar.txt" (which doesn't exist yet) for
# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make 
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain
