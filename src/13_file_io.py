Python makes performing file I/O simple. Take a look
at how to read and write to files here:

"""

# Open up the "foo.txt" file (which already exists) for reading
# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file
# Note: pay close attention to your current directory when trying to open "foo.txt"

# YOUR CODE HERE
with open("src/foo.txt") as foo_file:
    # contents = foo_file.read()
    # print(contents)
    for line in foo_file:
        print(line)


# Open up a file called "bar.txt" (which doesn't exist yet) for
# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain

# YOUR CODE HERE
joke = open("joke.text", "w")

joke.write(" Knock knock \n Who's there? \n ma damn ")

joke.close()
