x = 10
y = 2.24552
z = "I like turtles!"

# Using the printf operator (%), print the following feeding in the values of x,
# y, and z:
print ("%s is 10, %s is 2.25, %s is I like turtles!" % (x, y,z))



# Use the 'format' string method to print the same thing

# Finally, print the same thing using an f-string
