"""
Python provides a number of ways to perform printing. Research
how to print using the printf operator, the `format` string 
method, and by using f-strings.

x = 10
y = 2.24552
z = "I like turtles!"

# Using the printf operator (%), print the following feeding in the values of x,
# y, and z:
# x is 10, y is 2.25, z is "I like turtles!"
print("x is %d, y is %f, z is %s" %(x, y, z))
# Use the 'format' string method to print the same thing
txt = "x is {x:.0f}, y is {y:.5f}, z is {z}"
print(txt.format(x=x, y=y, z=z))
# Finally, print the same thing using an f-string
txt1 = f"x is {x}, y is {y}, z is {z}"
print(txt1)
