# Write a loop that:
    # * Prints the current room name
    # * Prints the current description (the textwrap module might be useful here).
    # * Waits for user input and decides what to do.
    # * If the user enters a cardinal direction, attempt to move to the room there.
    # * Print an error message if the movement isn't allowed.
    # * If the user enters "q", quit the game.
    # * Add functionality that prints out all the items that are visible to the player when they are in that room.
    # * Add a new type of sentence the parser can understand: two words in the form of [verb] [item] (e.g. take coins)
