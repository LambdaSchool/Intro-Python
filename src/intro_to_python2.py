""" Intro to Python II - Guided Project
    This document contains examples for CS Intro to Python, module 2. Examples
    will highlight unique syntax rules in Python. Students will continue to
    practice creating elements such as lists, dictionaries, and functions. 
    Additionally, we will look at the CS problem-solving framework and practice
    using it to break down more complex problems.

# in a single line, create a new list containing all of the temperatures from

# create a dictionary students in which their `id` is the key and their name
# is the `value`?

# When we write functions in different languages, it is important to know if

# UPER - Given a number of people, number of pizzas, and number of slices per
# pizza, write a function to evenly divide the slices between each person.
# 1. Understand
# - How do we know #s? (passed as args in fuction)
# - Is everyone eating? (yes)
# - Min/Max (positive int values)
# - Half slices? (no)
# - Cost per slice? (n/a)
# - Slices same size? (yes)
# - Return # slices per person? (yes + # of leftovers that no one gets) 

# 2. Plan
def divide_pizza(people, pizzas, slices):
    # Find total num of slices (pizza*slice)
    # Do division
        # Find "floor" (slices per person)
        # Find remainder (leftovers)
    # Return info as string

# 3. Execute
def divide_pizza(people, pizzas, slices):
    total_slices = pizzas * slices
    # Do division
    slices_per_person = total_slices // people
    leftovers = total_slices % people

    # Return info as string

# UPER - Prompt a user to enter three, uique numbers as input, print out 
# which number is the largest of the three. 
# 1. Understand
    # - are all the numbers different/duplicates?
    # - lists items
    # - reference numbers back 
    # - set 
# 2. Plan
    # - We have to return the largest of the three
# 3. Execute

# UPER - Write a function that returns the "centered" average of an array of 
# ints, which we'll say is the mean average of the values, except ignoring the 
# largest and smallest values in the array. 
# centered_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 100]) → 3
# centered_average([1, 1, 5, 5, 10, 8, 7]) → 5
# centered_average([-10, -4, -2, -4, -2, 0]) → -3
